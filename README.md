<h1>Esoteric Interpreter</h1>
<p>Interpret an esoteric programming language's code and handle errors.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>BF is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. The language only has eigth commands, but it is fully Turing complete. BF has no practical uses, but it does challenge programmers, while testing the bounds of computer science.</p>

<h2>How to Code in BF</h2>
<ol>
  <li>'>' Forward pointer. Tell C++ to point to the memory block that is infront of the current memory block</li>
  <li>'<' Backward pointer. Tell C++ to point to the memory block that is behind the current memory block</li>
  <li>'.' Print. Tell C++ to print what is in the memory block that C++ is currently pointing too</li>
  <li>',' User input. Tell C++ to take user input</li>
  <li>'+' Increment. Tell C++ to increment the memory block by 1</li>
  <li>'-' Decrement. Tell C++ to decrement the memory block by 1</li>
  <li>'[' Start a loop. Tell C++ where the start a loop is located. When a loop starts over it will go to wherever the '[' char is located</li>
  <li>']' End a loop. Tell C++ where the end of a loop is located. A Loop will only end if the value of the current memory block is 0 and the current char being read is '['</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
  <li>This interpreter does not read white spaces</li>
  <li>Loops must start and end on the same line</li>
  <li>There are 30,000 memory blocks</li>
  <li>Each memory block is initialized with the value 0</li>
  <li>Each memory block cannot be more than 127</li>
  <li>Each memory block cannot be less than -128</li>
  <li>Attemping to go above 127, or below -128, will result in an error</li>
  <li>If during user input a user enter a std::string each char will be put in a memory block of it's own</li>
  <li>The BF code must be stored in a .bf file</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example of Good BF Code</h2>

<h2>Enviorment</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Built in Visual Studio 2022</li>
  <li>C++ Language standard: ISO C++20 Standard (/std:c++20)</li>
  <li>C Language standard: ISO C17 (2018) Standard (/std:c17)</li>
  <li>Complied on the x64 platform</li> 
</ol>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>When running the unit test ensure that Visual Studio Code 2022's configuration manager is set to Debug, or else not all the assert functions will not be called.</p>
